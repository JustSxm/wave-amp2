## Make your own songs
wave-amp2 uses nbs files for music storage. You can create your own songs using [Note Block Studio](https://www.stuffbydavid.com/mcnbs) or the newer open-source version [Open Note Block Studio](https://opennbs.org/)

With Note Block Studio you can convert midi versions of your favourite songs to nbs files ans play them in-game.

## Command line arguments
```
wave-amp -h

-l                      lists all outputs connected to the computer.
-c <config file>        loads the parameters from a file. parameters are separated by newlines.
-t <theme file>         loads the theme from a file.
-f <filter[:second]>    sets the note filter for the outputs.
examples:
-f 10111                sets the filter for all outputs to remove the bass instrument.
-f 10011:01100          sets the filter so the bass and basedrum instruments only come out of the second output
-v <volume[:second]>    sets the volume for the outputs.
--nrm --stp --rep --shf sets the play mode.
--noui --noinput        disables the ui/keyboard input
--exit                  to reboot the system after a song played
